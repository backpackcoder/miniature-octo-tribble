# miniature-octo-tribble
The project is an attempt to compare a simple CRUD application between several frameworks
and technologies.  The initial app will include a simple data model displaying information
on a map.  This should allow comparisons of the data access/ORM technologies, server
technologies, and client UI frameworks. 

## Projects
The initial plan for for 3 server technologies, Dotnet-Core, MEANJS, and Python.

### dotnet-core
The dotnet-core app uses ASP.NET razor templating and server page technology and uses
entity framework for it's ORM persisting the data to a SQLite database.

### MEANJS
The MEAN stack assessment uses [MEANJS](http://meanjs.org) scaffolding for budiling the
web app.


### Python
Web framework and technologies to be determined
